This is a workaround to allow your teammates to accesss and collaborate on your project repository.

1. Go to your repository > Settings > Collaborators and teams
   You can also use this link format: `https://github.com/AEENI-UF/devhunt-edition-1-YOURREPONAME/settings/access`

2. Click Add people button, and search the username of your teammate that is still not in your team and doesn't have access to your repo.
   
<img src="./img/Add people to repo.png"/>
   ![[Add people to repo.png]]

Give them write access:

![[Give write access to repo.png]]

3. They should now have access to your repository and you can collaborate on your project together.
